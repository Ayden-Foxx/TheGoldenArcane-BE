### # GOLDEN ARCANE, by Ayden_Foxx
# All changes to the mod's functional code are written here on each update, as of 0.1.0.
# For versions prior to that, see "Legacy_CHANGELOG.txt"


## v0.1.0
★ Overhauled Golden Arcane as a whole! With new items, mechanics, and revamped existing ones, this version has a lot of new stuff.
+ UPDATED mod's namespace: gdark -> goldark
 • "gdark" is now used as an abbreviation in some more internal mechanics
+ "TRAITS & TALES" MERGED with GOLDEN ARCANE, "Werewoof" path inherited.
 • NEW "Arcane Paths" mechanic added to expand this
+ Some internal redesigns to code & folder structure

# v0.1.1
+ "GOLDEN ARROW" MERGED with GOLDEN ARCANE
+ New item: Dark Seal. [[add more later]]
 • As of 26/08, the Dark Seal has a single ability to push monsters aside, and block most incoming projectiles, specially arrows.
  • It is also planned to be capable of "banishing" enemies to out of the player's sight, should they get too close.
 • This item replaces the "SoulLock" Spell in previous versions of GOLDEN ARCANE
+ Added DASH ability to Golden Arrow, as well as a melee/ranged toggle function
+ Updated internal structure, now working with various subfolders and "cores" inside each major subfolder. Cores will contain all functions which need to be looped constantly, and will be connected to a Main Core at the root folder.
* Future feature: "Vempyre" & "Faeri" updates to TRAITS & TALES.

# v0.1.2
+ Added ARROW IMBUE ability to Golden Arrow. Arrows will summon Evocation Fangs when missing a hit, and will still do so even on ground, but will despawn after 5 seconds.
+ Strays near the player have a 1/1500 chance to be replaced by Golden Arrow every tick.
 • This will trigger its own spawn message to all players, regardless of distance.
+ Golden Arrow now has a special function for when they or the players are defeated, and will send chat messages accordingly.
+ Being far from Golden Arrow for too long now also despawns them.
+ Minor changes to Golden Arrow's spawning animation, tweaks to particles displayed.
+ Increased Golden Arrow's DASH ability duration (1.5s -> 2s), decreased speed while dashing, and fixed a bug with gear not returning when the dash was completed.
* Starting to question how far should I take these update logs...

# v0.1.3
+ Added CHARGED SHOT ability to Golden Arrow. When active, Golden Arrow's next ranged attack will cause a thunder strike w/ a DoT.
+ Added a custom boss bar to Golden Arrow while it is alive. Right now, the bar is purely cosmetic and doesn't deplete at all.
+ Fixed a bug where Golden Arrow would refuse to spawn without their boss bar.
+ Tweaked ARROW IMBUE to allow more room for dodging.
+ Tweaked Abilities' cooldowns and requirements, now requiring less distance to be triggered. Golden Arrow now also heals themselves at specific intervals, or with a rare chance if other Abilites are unavailable.
+ Fixed ARROW IMBUE and CHARGED SHOT to use their own relative position instead of the player's.
 • This pretty much "fixes" the previous fix, which should've done this exact same thing, but didn't.
+ Golden Arrow's Abilities now roll the dice once, and calculates viable Abilities with the same number afterwards.
 • Previously, a new number was generated every time an Ability could be triggered.
 • Together with the previous tweak, these make all Abilities slightly more common.
+ Severely increased odds to a naturally-spawning Golden Arrow by tenfold, now with a 1/5000 chance.
 • This should more accurately reflect Golden Arrow's rarity, as previously instances would replace Strays within seconds after a previous one was defeated.
* Oh frick. This is definitely an update.

# v0.1.4
* CHARGED SHOTS (on distance) are now "Nox Sagitta"; ARROW IMBUE is now "Spears of Doom"; When close, "Nox Sagitta" will become "Vocare Tenebra", a new powerful attack which summons minions instead of attacks.
+ Lowered one y-level on ARROW IMBUE's Fang attack, so arrows may now summon an Evocation Fang one block forward to where they hit.
• Arrows on the floor are now capable of hitting the player again.
* Added Luke.
+ Golden Arrow now regularly heals every Ability cycle, with a chance to heal some extra hearts when no ability is chosen.
★ Revamped code structure, renamed variables and functions, and reworked its internal code.
+ Golden Arrow now sends a message every time a special ability is chosen.
+ Sounds will now be relative to the players' location instead of Golden Arrow's, as some of them couldn't barely be heard at all in most realistic scenarios.
+ The player now receives a "penalty" for attempting to flee the fight. It won't harm directly, but will calse some troubles.

## v0.1.5
+ Revamped Golden Arrow's internal code structure, again. This time overhauling the code structure for in-battle behavior, which should hopefully make it easier to manage and add new features.

## v0.2.0
★ Due to several major overhauls and breaking changes in the last updates, it was more than in time for a new number. Also for the fact I'm taking this again after a few months long hiatus.
+ Changed several namespace usage instances to use `goldark` instead; Now only translation keys still use the old `gdark` namespace.
+ Major overhaul to the ALTAR Module from Golden Arrow: Now allows proper sacrificing, summoning, self-destruction, and more.
+ Minor tweaks to the CURSE Module from Golden Arrow: Updated tags & variables to the newest `goldark` system; Added a `music` Curse Effect, which may be played just like other major Effects (e.g. `dialogues`).
+ Now `player.cursed` and `player.curse_lift` may coexist at the same time. Previous code which checked for the exclusivity of one now checks for the presence or not of the `player.curse_lift` tag.
 • Technically, this also makes the Player canonically Cursed forever...
+ Minor changes to how messages are displayed. Now most dialogues trigger slightly closer, and also require previous interaction with the Golden Curse at some point.
+ The BATTLE and CURSE Module now only run when Golden Arrow is present or not in the world, respectively.
+ Revamped Golden Arrow's summoning ritual, now uses its own custom dummy entity and multiple sounds until Golden Arrow's arrival.
+ (Finally) Introduced ALTAR Activation mechanic, activating a new ALTAR by putting an Armor Stand above it.
+ Added separate function for checking the ALTAR's Soul charges in order to start a ritual; A new message has also been added for when the Player attempts to summon Golden Arrow while the ALTAR has no Soul charges.
+ Now active ALTARs have special particles and regularly play ambient sounds.
* This *would* be a Major version if 1.0.0 wasn't reserved for release...

* Once the BATTLE Module is complete, the separate pack "Golden Arrow - The Fallen" will be available separately at release v1.0.0. Nice! :)


## v0.2.1
+ Fixed several bugs with v0.2.0's release.
+ Updated a handful more functions & files to use `goldark` instead of the former `gdark`.
 • Translation keys and LEGACY code are the only ones to still provide support to the `gdark` namespace.
+ Custom entity `summon_ga` renamed to `altar_trigger` to match `altar_spot`; Now both are also unaffected by water, and `altar_trigger` is properly affected by gravity.
 • ...Despite the fact the ALTAR can't actually be built underwater, since it requires a ring of redstone dust.
+ Now Golden Arrow will ignore any player without the proper `player.in_battle`, instead of attacking any Cursed player in sight.
 • This goes both ways too, as only in-battle Players will be able to damage Golden Arrow.
+ Added header comments to a few functions which didn't had one yet.
+ The `gift` Curse Effect has been updated (as per request from issue #1), now containing double the amount of items from before, ranging from TRASH, COMMON or even RARE drops.
 • Golden Arrow's many pumpkin-related gifts may have some Lore implications for the future.
