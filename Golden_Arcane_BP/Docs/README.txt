★ •. GOLDEN ARCANE .* +
"In an alternate reality, magic seems to have infused itself on a quite unusual metal: Gold. And with just this subtle change, many other supernatural events started taking place, everywhere. And now it is your turn, PLAYER, to harness this power and ascend to a greater level than ever before. [...]"

• The Addon is in memory of "Our Tales", Ayden's most beloved world, which helped him with some of the worst times in their lives.
Creations, items, creatures and all features included here are inspired by said world, which unfortunately got deleted by the phone's Trash Cleaner function.
That world, along with its odd characters and mystical properties, shall live on within this pack.


---------------------------------------------


## ★ Golden Arcane!
• Several new items, including Spell Charms & Scrolls, artifacts, tools and some "ores"
• New spells! These are sure to spice up your world and allow a new way to approach your everyday survival life
• New creatures! Most of them coming from OT's (Our Tales') mythology and unusual apparitions, and others being based on it while still keeping the "Golden Arcane" style
• Weapons, armor, tools and all kinds of stuff, mostly dropped from entities

This pack started mostly as a small project to recreate OT's unique properties to other worlds, but since its loss has become a more serious thing to honor its memory.

With you, the Addon of the Golden Light.
