#> >> GOLDEN ARROW - THE FALLEN <<
#> This is the main function, where all code is put together to create
#> everything. Mainly used to connect Local COREs, but also runs some
#> miscellaneous code, where a sub-folder of its own would be a waste.

# ? Includes detection, activation, summoning, and more.
