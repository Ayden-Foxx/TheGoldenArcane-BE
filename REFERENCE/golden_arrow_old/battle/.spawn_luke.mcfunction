## # Secret Function? -- On defeat, Golden
# Arrow has a rare chance to summon a special
# wolf, called "Luke". This is a reference to
# "Our Tales", where upon the defeat of the
# original Golden Arrow, a stray wolf came to
# Ayden's house, and without any other living
# being nearby, he decided to adopt it,
# naming them "Luke". Luke was a loyal
# friend, a brave doggo, and a great
# companionship. The last moment Ayden was in
# Our Tales, before it was destroyed, Luke
# was on his side, and stayed with him until
# the last moment. This is a tribute to him,
# the now ascended doggo who lives in a
# better place, where bones are plenty and
# the dangers are gone.
#
# This is for you, little doggy.
