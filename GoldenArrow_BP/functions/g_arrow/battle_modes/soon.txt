* This future mechanic will define how hard/dangerous Golden Arrow is, based on how many Players are challenging them at once.
* It also limits fights to only up to 8 players, as anything beyond that will cause G. Arrow to refuse to fight.
* A "Hard Mode" option might be added in the future, enabling the 8-Player Mode even on Singleplayer.
* However, some changes might be needed to be actually challenging to larger groups (who would be fighting with 8 Players anyway).


1 PLAYER - "Fun Encounter", Primary Skills, light HEAL, 80 HP & 0.3 Speed
- Golden Arrow disappears after a minute without nearby Players in this mode, but never due to the Player's defeat.

2 PLAYERS - "Double Trouble", Primary & Secondary Skills, increased HEAL, 120HP, same speed
- Golden Arrow despawns if both Players are dead at the same time.

3-4 PLAYERS - "A True Challenge!", Primary, Secondary Skills, Special Abilities, full power HEAL, 200HP & 0.5 speed
- When a Player dies, they'll be no longer considered in battle, and will be weakened just like any other Player. When no tagged player is alive anymore, GA despawns.

5-7 PLAYERS - "Unfairness Active", Primary, Secondary & Special Skills, faster game tick, full power HEAL, 250HP & 0.8 speed
- A special loot is spawned to all players individually in this mode, besides what is dropped from Golden Arrow on defeat.

8 PLAYERS / HARD MODE - "All or Nothing", All Skills, even faster game tick, extreme HEAL (due to tick speed), 300HP & 1.0 speed (how fast is that lol)
- A timer is also added below GA's boss bar, for one exact minute; Once the timer ends, GA disappears and all players are heavily injured.


9+ PLAYERS: [NO FIGHT]
- Golden Arrow has a custom line of dialog, but will not spawn. The Altar will not consume a charge with a failed summoning attempt.
