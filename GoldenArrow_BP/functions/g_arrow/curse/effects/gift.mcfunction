## # GOLDEN ARROW Has a Weird Taste for GIFTs...
## Golden Arrow may randomly insert a random item into the Player's inventory.
## Just like with effects, these may range from literal trash to actually useful stuff.
## This has no warning to the Player other than a quick sound cue.

# Most "trash" items stop appearing once the curse is broken, but rare goods will still be (rarely) gifted.
