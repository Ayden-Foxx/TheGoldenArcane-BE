# Golden_Arrow
As a sub-pack of the **Golden Arcane**, *Golden Arrow - The Fallen* gives life again to the iconic antagonist of
"Our Tales", now with its own summon mechanics, custom boss battle, and dialogues to expand the lore more than ever.

At the time of writing this (07/09), the pack is still *private*, and is still in very early development.
A small beta is planned as soon as the addon is stable enough for distribution, with an official release
likely happening by the end of October or mid-November.
