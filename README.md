# ðŸŒŸ â€¢ Golden Arcane *.
> "When the magic filled our hearts and Soul, and when the golden light was so infused in our reality, **Golden Arcane** was born."

*Golden Arcane* is an Addon with a simple yet impactful concept: Granting an almost unused metal powerful magical properties.
As a result, many creatures have been granted unusual powers, and even foes became stronger than ever.

*Some also say of legendary heroes rising from the dead by corrupt powers... But no living witness has proven their existance anyway.*

Featuring:
-
+ Many changes to various mobs' behaviors, with some new abilities to hostile ones...
+ New *Soul Paths*, a new mechanic akin to *origins* from the [Origins Mod](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/origins). You may choose a *path* to follow as a magic practicioner, and said path will influence how you interact with the world's magic and inhabitants. Each path is based on a different mythological creature (but made poorly), like *Werewooves*, *Vempyres*, *Faeries*, and many more!
+ Some fruits of foreign lands seem to have unusual effects when consumed... Would you give it a taste?
+ New structures, where you may find useful items, hidden Lore, new foes or even *absolutely nothing*. Who knows?
+ New bosses and "mini"-bosses, many of them having a quite familiar look...
+ An expanding Lore containing heroes of the past, unhinged masterminds, a forgotten civilization... What else can you find in this endless world?
+ May contain way too op foes to absolutely destroy players who dare to challenge them. Oops.

(All of the features above can be turned on/off anytime by changing the `goldark.gameContent` value in-game. For a detailed list of all possible values for any configuration, see [this](CONFIGS.md) file.)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When first creating a world, you must run the command `/function goldark/world_setup` once. This is for setting up all variables the Addon may use.
> *In the future, this may be done automatically, requiring no previous action from the user.*
