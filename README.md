# ðŸŒŸ Same world, a new magic.

**Gold** -- on the surface, a not so interesting, relatively common metal in Minecraft. With poorer items than iron, and no actual use other than clocks or (since 1.16+) piglin bartering, its no wonder people are so quick to dismiss it.  
  

But what if there was more than the eyes meet? What if this simple shiny metal had more to it than what one could assume just by a first contact?  
  

What if some of gold's most unique and unexplained properties -- such as its immense power when infused in food, or its unique capacity to spawn in more than one dimension in Minecraft -- had actual relevance to something far greater, yet to be uncovered? (or even *re-uncovered*, perhaps?)  
  

*Golden Arcane* is an Addon with a simple yet impactful concept: Exploring this often forgotten metal's properties and potential for the supernatural, offering both Players and their foes a new opportunity for power and a new way to interact with the world around them!

Some foes may have taken it even beyond, quite literally, becoming major  antagonists to the Addon. If you see some undead mobs walking weirdly at nights in full golden armour, better think twice before messing with any of them...

*The legends of mythical creatures and corrupted old warriors sure are plenty, but living witnesses are nearly none. Do as ye wish, but be careful out there; If not taken seriously, one of those encounters could be your last.*

## âœ¨ Featuring:

- Many changes to various mobs' behaviors, with some new abilities to hostile ones...
- New *Soul Paths*, a new mechanic akin to *origins* from the [Origins Mod](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/origins). You may choose a *path* to follow as a magic practicioner, and said path will influence how you interact with the world's magic and inhabitants. Each path is based on a different mythological creature (but poorly), like *Werewooves*, *Vempyres*, *Faeries*, and many more!
- Some fruits of foreign lands seem to have unusual effects when consumed... Would you give it a taste?
- New structures, where you may find useful items, hidden Lore, new foes or even *absolutely nothing*. Who knows?
- New bosses and "mini"-bosses, many of them having a quite familiar look...
- An expanding Lore containing heroes of the past, unhinged masterminds, a forgotten civilization... What else can you find in this endless world?
- May contain way too op foes to absolutely destroy new players who dare to challenge. Oops.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When first creating a world, you must run the command `/function goldark/setup` *once*.
> This will set up everything the Addon needs to work properly.
<!--Might become automatic later, though.-->
